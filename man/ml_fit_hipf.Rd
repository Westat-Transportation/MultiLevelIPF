\title{Estimate weights using Hierarchical Iterative Proportional Fitting}
\usage{
ml_fit_hipf(fitting_problem, tol = 1e-06, maxiter = 500, verbose = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{fitting_problem}{A fitting problem created by
\code{\link{fitting_problem}}.}

\item{tol}{Tolerance, the algorithm stops when all target values are reached
within this tolerance.}

\item{maxiter}{Maximum number of iterations.}

\item{verbose}{If \code{TRUE}, print diagnostic output.}
}
\value{
An object of classes \code{ml_fit_hipf} and \code{ml_fit}.
}
\description{
This function reweights a reference sample to match constraints given by
aggregate controls by means of Hierarchical Iterative Proportional Fitting.
